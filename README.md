# Flask Web App
This web app was built for Aviator Flight Center, an approved training organisation. The pilot instructors will be able to use this web application to see the training manuals without the ability to copy, download or share them to others out of the organisation. An account is created and given to the instructor by the admin in order to have access to the training manuals. This web app is delpoyed on heroku.
